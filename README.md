# Clinic-Management-System
This was my 2nd year minor project.
How to run the application? Follow below steps:-

1. If you dont have JDK 1.8 or above installed on your pc then, open the "jdk" folder and installed it.
   NB: If the application doesnt run with jdk 1.8 then kindly download newer version from the website.

2. open "database" folder and install the xampp application. 
   NB: internet connection might require to fully installed the application.

3. After successfully installing the xampp application on your pc, open the xammp application and Start the
   "Apache" and "MySQL" Modules.

4. After starting the modules, open any web browser and visit the link below:-
   http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
   NB: link will not work if you havent started the modules mention in the above step 3.

5. After opening the link, click on the "Import" tab and then click on the option "Choose File".
   It will let you browse files on your computer. 
   Choose "clinic_management.sql" file from your "database" folder. it will import sql files
   and create database automatically named as "clinic_management". Check on the left side of your screen.
   NB: you can perform any database activity here like add, delete, update and so on. Editing and 
       modifying values of your application from here is not recomended since it will serve you with an error.

6. Now run "Clinic.exe" from your application folder. Voila! you have a running application.
